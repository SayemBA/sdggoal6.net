	<h1 class="head"><u>Clean water and sanitation</u></h1>
	<p class="peter">This is one of the goals of Sustainable Development Goals(SDG). One in three people live without sanitation. This is causing unnecessary disease and death. Although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. If we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life.</p>
	<h1 class="hed"><u>The Targets</u></h1>
	<p class="peter">Everyone can help to make sure that we meet the Global Goals.<br>
	 Use these eight targets to ensure clean water and sanitation for all.</p><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="1trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="2trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">END OPEN DEFECATION AND PROVIDE<br> ACCESS TO SANITATION AND HYGIENE</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="3trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">IMPROVE WATER QUALITY, WASTEWATER<br> TREATMENT AND SAFE REUSE</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="4trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">INCREASE WATER-USE EFFICIENCY AND<br> ENSURE FRESHWATER SUPPLIES</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="5trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED WATER<br> RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="6trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">PROTECT AND RESTORE WATER-<br>RELATED ECOSYSTEMS</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="7trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">EXPAND WATER AND SANITATION<br> SUPPORT TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</h2>
	 <p class="peter">By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <img class="sixth" src="8trg.png">
	 <h2 class="tagtwo">SUPPORT LOCAL ENGAGEMENT IN WATER<br> AND SANITATION MANAGEMENT</h2>
	 <p class="peter">Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	 <h2 class="had"><u>THINKS TO DO</u></h2><br><br>
	 <p class="peter"><b>1. Find a Goal 6 charity you want to support. Any donation, big or small, can make a difference!</b></p>
	 <p class="peter"><b>2. Run a campaign on hygiene. Raise awareness about the hygiene issues in your community through social media, school/university campaign or even a campaign in the neighborhood you live in.</b></p>
	 <p class="peter"><b>3. Organize a clean up project for rivers and oceans. Engage your whole community to clean up a local river, seaside or an ocean.</b></p>
	 <p class="peter"><b>4. 4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services. Lend your voice to talk about the lack of toilets in many communities around the world!</b></p>
	 <p class="peter"><b>5. Don’t overuse water. Make sure to close a tap when washing dishes, take short showers – Bathtubs require gallons more water than a 5-10 minute shower. Consider getting a water meter to be aware of your water usage.</b></p>
	 <p class="peter"><b>6. Stay informed. Follow your local news and stay in touch with the Global Goals online or on social media at </b>
